		"description": "This website is currently the most complex website I have designed so far.  It has been created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some JQuery code. Wireframes were created in Adobe InDesign, and transferred them to code.  I borrowed some code in order to create each portfolio piece's modal, but I styled the text and image formatting in each modal to fit my needs.  I plan on adding more functionality, such as responsiveness, in the future.",

		"description": "This website was developed over the course of an entire semester for my Web Design and Development class. The design of the website took many iterations to bring it to where it currently stands. In creating this website, I worked a lot with jQuery, page animations, tooltips, and DRY methodology. It's purpose is to cater to audiences who may either want to learn more about Bitcoin through it's history, or find out what exactly it is.",

I interned for two months at Technion University in the Computer Graphics Department, traveled the country, and was able to experience culture-shock first hand.  This blog was my effort to record everything that happened, and I played with the CSS to make it look a lot more pleasing than it originally did.",

I've updated the text recently, but the website was created at the beginning of my second year in college.",
