		"description": "This app combines the knowledge I gathered from my co-op at Cengage Learning about web apps. It converts a given input value (integer or decimal) into English words. Maven and Tomcat are used to build and locally host the app, while Google App Engine hosts the app live at a domain. A Java servlet attempts to validate all input before the number conversion takes place, and notifies a user if the input does not meet the criteria for conversion.",

The program will inform the user if a guess is higher or lower than the target number, keep a list of past guess for the current game, and save a user's lowest number of guesses.",

		"description": "This MP3 player is completely customizable with XML!  Some features of this player are: it displays extended song information for a song that is clicked on, a user can sort songs by four different categories, pause/rewind/next song controls are implemented, current time progress for each song is tracked, and there is a page system. Since it takes such a long time to download from Github, I'm working on featuring it somewhere on this website.",
